# Wine Quality Prediction Dataset Documentation

## Overview

The Wine Quality Prediction dataset is a collection of wine-related features used for predicting the quality rating of wines. This dataset is relevant for wine quality assessment tasks and can be used for regression and classification purposes.

## Dataset Information

- **Dataset Name**: Winequality-white
- **Data Source**: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
- **Data Description**: This dataset contains 4,898 records of wines and 12 features, including various chemical properties and sensory attributes.

## Features

1. **Fixed Acidity**: (float) The fixed acidity of the wine.
2. **Volatile Acidity**: (float) The volatile acidity of the wine.
3. **Citric Acid**: (float) The citric acid content in the wine.
4. **Residual Sugar**: (float) The residual sugar content in the wine.
5. **Chlorides**: (float) The chlorides content in the wine.
6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: (int) The amount of free sulfur dioxide in the wine.
7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: (int) The total sulfur dioxide in the wine.
8. **Density**: (float) The density of the wine.
9. **pH**: (float) The pH level of the wine.
10. **Sulphates**: (float) The amount of sulfates in the wine.
11. **Alcohol**: (float) The alcohol content in the wine.
12. **Quality**: (int) The quality rating of the wine, ranging from 3 to 8.

## Target Variable

The target variable for this dataset is "Quality," representing the quality rating of the wine. It is an integer variable ranging from 3 to 8.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset underwent the following preprocessing steps:

- Data Cleaning: Missing values were handled appropriately.
- Feature Engineering: No new features were created, but some feature scaling may have been applied.
- Scaling/Normalization: Features were scaled to ensure consistent ranges.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA revealed key insights into the dataset:

- Summary Statistics: Descriptive statistics were calculated for each feature.
- Distribution Plots: Histograms and density plots were used to visualize feature distributions.
- Correlation Analysis: Correlation matrices were generated to identify relationships between features.

## Model Building

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated on this dataset:

- Model Selection: Models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression,Support vector regressor, and Gradient Boosting were considered.
- Model Training: Models were trained with cross-validation, and hyperparameters were tuned.
- Model Evaluation: Performance metrics, including MSE and R-squared, were used to assess model performance.

## Results

Based on extensive experimentation and evaluation, the Support vector Regression model demonstrated superior performance. It achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the highest R-squared (R2) score, making it the recommended model for wine quality prediction.

## Limitations

- Limited Dataset: The dataset contains a finite number of records, which may limit the model's generalization.
- Quality Rating Scale: The quality rating scale ranges from 3 to 8, which may not provide fine-grained predictions.

## Future Work

Future work may include collecting additional wine data to enhance model performance and exploring advanced regression techniques. Additionally, fine-tuning model hyperparameters could further improve prediction accuracy.
